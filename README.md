# beakerlib
Beakerlib fork for multiplatform usage (including other linuxes, Windows and Mac)

A little bit experimental fork of work being done in mainstream:
https://fedorahosted.org/beakerlib/

May not be updated regularly. Perhaps just a temporary place
until multiplatform support gets integrated into mainstream.

Use on your own risk :-).
